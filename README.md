# About the project
Since I struggle to find a accurate tool (including GPT) to convert musicXML data to music notation, wrote an example with VexFlow library.
This example takes the input in a different part of the project so you might want to modify the beginning.
I think everything is pretty clear with the comments but do not hesitate to ask something if you sturggle.
